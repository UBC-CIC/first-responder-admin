# This is to generate GraphQL files for Frontend/Lambdas based on 'schema.graphql'.
# Amplify codegen is used to generate GraphQL files out of schema.graphql.
# We don't use other amplify cli at all.
#
# Usage :
# cd /graphql
# amplify init // DO NOT RUN 'amplify push'
# amplify codegen types
# amplify codegen statements
