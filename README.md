Emergency Responders connect to the Service Desk, where an attendee can assist them, and connect them to a specialist who can provide medical expertise. The Service Desk supports geo-location, and provides a dashboard for managing ongoing emergency calls. The App is Powered by Amazon Chime, supporting video, audio, and text chat.
